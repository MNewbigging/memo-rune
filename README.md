## How to play Memo Rune
        
Memo Rune is a simple pair matching game - find all the matching pairs to win
        
The runes are face-down normally. On your turn, select a rune to flip it over
        
Each turn, you can select two runes to flip over - if they both match you get a point and those runes are removed.

If you do get a match, you can go again!
        
Watch out though, the panel on the left shows a collection of 'danger runes' which are non-matching. If you uncover two runes that both appear in that collection of danger runes it gives you a negative point - the red score in brackets. When this happens, the danger runes are shuffled.

Choose the game size to determine how many rune pairs to play with - this game also supports local two player!
